##VSMZ80 - Cycle accurate Z80 for Proteus

This is a model for emulating the Z80 CPU inside Labcenter Proteus.
It is a work in progress to emulate the Z80 CPU inside Proteus and allow for the creating of virtual Z80 computers.
Right now some of the functionality is emulated and it already runs a very simple code (included).

##Building

To build, just open the project on VS2015 and hit "Build". It should build with no errors.

##Testing

A simple design, called TestJig, is included, to test the built .DLL.
